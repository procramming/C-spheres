# C-spheres
programming project I did for Principles of Programming language class

Gets input, from the command line, and converts them into sphere, and projects them.

uses structs for ray type, sphere type, etc.

the camera location is 0,0,0, and faces toward positive x. the image is set to view from camera to box ranging from -0.5 ~ +0.5x and -0.5y ~ +0.5y.

it will be better to set the input a file and output a ppm file.

works on all machines with C compiler.
